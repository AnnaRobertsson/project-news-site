## Project nr. 1 - News Site
To get accustomed to HTML and CSS, our first assignment was to build a news site of a topic of our choice. The site needed to have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles, arranged using Flexbox and Grid, styled and with a responsive design. I have a background as an ophthalmic nurse, therefore I chose a news site about eye health.

## The problem
I started with the responsive navbar, that also had a hamburger menu, which was found in an article. The article wasn't written in mobile first though which I didn't see as a very big problem from the start. I used it but encountered a lot of challenges later on with removing the media query for mobiles when I had to sort out where to put everything and what changes I needed to make in the media queries for tablet and desktop. To solve this I played around in Codepen and also studied most of the elements in dev tools to try to see exactly what they targeted and how they behaved if I changed them. I spent a lot of time on this and asked a friend who's an experienced web developer to look at it when I felt like I had sorted it out to see if he agreed.

I also faced a lot of challenges with using grid especially and placing the elements, mainly the small articles, within it. I got it to a working grid system with 1-2-4 grid cells, but then I wanted to try and make it with 4-8-12 grid cells instead. I eventually got it to work but the code wasn't perhaps efficiently written so I was asked to change it back to simplify and reduce the code, which I did and that simplified a lot in the end with placing my articles.

I struggled with the articles sizes and the big article is a bit bigger than I would prefer, so that's a thing I would dive deeper into if I had more time.

I wanted the content of the main article to be about eye strain when using screens. I used ChatGPT to give me a short text about it and since it's a news site I asked for the text to be presented in a "clickbaity" way to get a more interesting headline.

Regarding the styling I didn't want the website to look too cluttered or have too many effects, as I imagine people with vision problems and/or eye diseases might show more interest in this type of site. The color theme was based on the color of The VISIONarys logo that I made in Canva. With that said, the news site might be a bit plain as of now, so if I had more time I would probably style it a bit more without making it too visually confusing.

For all my problems I have encountered I have used a combination of googling, reading sites as Stack Overflow, and asking for help from code coaches. I have also connected with a class mate so we have discussed upcoming problems we have faced as well which has been good. At the end I also discussed my issues with a friend who's a web developer to see if I was on the right track with how I was thinking of resolving the issues. I have also gone back to videos and text material provided by Technigo.
